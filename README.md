# Handwriting Recognition 2022 Group project
Group 6.

## Recognizers for Tasks 1 & 2 and Task 3
This repository contains both the recognizers for the DSS dataset, as well as for the IAM dataset. Note that, for 
running the bare recognizers, you **do not** need to clone the submodules listed in `./data`.
- Refer to the [IAM directory readme](./iam/readme.md) (`./iam`) for instructions on how to run the IAM recognizer.
- Refer to the [DSS directory readme](./dss/readme.md) (`./dss`) for instructions on how to run the DSS recognizer.

## Full installation
If you want to have full interaction with the CLI, to for instance run the recognizers on the full data-sets, you need
to pull all submodules. You can do so by running:
```shell
./install_full.sh
```
Note that this will take some time.
